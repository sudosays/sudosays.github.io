      <description>Pneuma (stylised as pneuma) is an interactive terminal frontend for managing a Hugo blog. As with Tempo, I built it for myself with the features I would like in it.
The aim of the project is to provide a slick, minimal frontend for managing posts in a Hugo blog including the ability to edit and create new posts, as well as publish drafts.</description>

      <description>This is my personal productivity app. It started from trying to merge the Pomodoro technique with a to-do list so that I could budget and plan my time. Other productivity apps I had used in the past featured either a timer only, or a to-do list, but not both. Furthermore, I use this to help keep me in a flow state by reducing the amount of effort I need to structure my work.</description>
