        It is time again for me to fill you in with another status update. I have been incredibly busy with my academics this past while which has left little time for side-projects (despite how much I would like to work on them). What little time I have free I have been surfing, meditating, doing yoga, and sleeping to try and recover and recoup.

        This post is inspired by the status updates of Drew DeVault (who remains a large inspiration for keeping this blog as a whole). This entry is a bit late, but better than never. In future I think I will also try to update at the middle of each month. This is also a chance to add updates from my life that do not warrant a full post here or may seem unrelated to the spirit of this blog.

        I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video here.
TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between the watch and gun and prevent it from firing.

        You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions, “How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive heat death anyway?”, to which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).
