        Money is the root of all evil. Our evil endeavors can only succeed if we are well funded. More so, our funds should come from either an untraceable or laundered source. While cryptocurrency is a viable payment method that seems reasonably untraceable, let us not stake our funds on a somewhat volatile market.

        Last night I finally managed to finish Daniel Levitin&rsquo;s The Organised Mind and while that phrasing might make it sound like this book was a drag, it was the exact opposite.

        While normally I would keep my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to myself, blogging more is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact.
