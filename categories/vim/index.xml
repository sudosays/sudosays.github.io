      <description>A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can read that here). Now, after using it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I have learned.
First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all beware your timeouts.
Vim on timeout After a while of using a custom leader key I started noticing that vim would lag for approximately a second every now and then.</description>

      <description>As far as using IDEs go, I wouldn’t say I’ve been around the block, but I’ve seen my fair share. It was only when I started running Arch Linux that I first switched to vim. At this point you might be expecting me to sing vim’s praises and how every developer worth their salt should be using it. I’m not going to.
The learning curve for vim is steep. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what the different modes meant, and everyday I use it I learn something new.</description>
