                TL;DR&rarr; In order to build an evil empire, one must be able to build. To build things that are robust and long lasting requires the carefully honed skill of the master. Mastery is required if one is to become an effective supervillain. It is important to develop a deep knowledge and mastery over the tools required for one&rsquo;s schemes.

                TL;DR&rarr; Producing propaganda takes priority for prospective pernicious persons. As a supervillian, it is important to be able to reach your audience and propagate your ideas. This blog is my version of that and for the last while I have been using the static site generator Hugo after migrating from Wordpress (see this post).

                TL;DR&rarr; Pneuma (stylised as pneuma) is an interactive terminal frontend for managing a Hugo blog. As with Tempo, I built it for myself with the features I would like in it.
 The aim of the project is to provide a slick, minimal frontend for managing posts in a Hugo blog including the ability to edit and create new posts, as well as publish drafts.

                TL;DR&rarr; One of the important factors in being a supervillain is that you need to be able to get your word out there. This can be for multiple reasons such as recruiting henchmen, drawing the ire of heroes, networking with other supervillains, and the list goes on. For an incipient supervillain such as myself, this comes in the form of my blog.
