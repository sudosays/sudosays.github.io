    <div class="post-content">
    <p>
The Fellowship of Evil Supervillains is a fictional organisation created and run
by myself for fun and evil.</p>
<p>
What you see here is the work of the propaganda arm of the Fellowship. The site
itself is generated from Org files using Hugo and hosted via Github. We aim to
make the content minimal, plain, and legible while making sure it is also really
fast.</p>
<p>
The content itself is published sporadically, but we also offer RSS feeds for
the entire site, or a subset such as the blog, tags, and categories.</p>
<p>
It is important to note that the pieces found here are living documents and as
such are subject to refinement and expansion over time.</p>
<p>
