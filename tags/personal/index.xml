      <description>Admittedly, the third week in January is a bit late to post my New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution, but better late than never.
Last year, I had a focus on growth with a community slant to it. I donated blood, contributed to an open source project and tried to add to myself.</description>

      <description>While normally I would keep my New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions to myself, blogging more is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact.</description>
