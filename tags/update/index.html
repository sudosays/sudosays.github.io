        Yet again it is time for another update. The past month I have been incredibly busy. I have recently taken up a lecturing position for a Java course at a local university. While entirely online/remote, the work is quite time consuming if not overly difficult. I have found it interesting to develop an effective workflow and schedule, and to find the relevant tools that allow me to do so.

        It is time again for me to fill you in with another status update. I have been incredibly busy with my academics this past while which has left little time for side-projects (despite how much I would like to work on them). What little time I have free I have been surfing, meditating, doing yoga, and sleeping to try and recover and recoup.

        This post is inspired by the status updates of Drew DeVault (who remains a large inspiration for keeping this blog as a whole). This entry is a bit late, but better than never. In future I think I will also try to update at the middle of each month. This is also a chance to add updates from my life that do not warrant a full post here or may seem unrelated to the spirit of this blog.
