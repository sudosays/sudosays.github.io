        What a year this has been. I am sure many are starting their end of the year posts like this, but if it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate now, it never will be. This year I set out my goals/resolutions with the theme of growth, specifically I chose things that were always deferred and, well, if this year was not almost deferred itself.

        In my 2020 vision, I mentioned that this year I wanted to contribute to an open source project and I am happy to announce that my first ever pull request was merged. This post mainly concerns my experience of the contribution process and my thoughts throughout rather than an in depth technical report.

        Last night I finally managed to finish Daniel Levitin&rsquo;s The Organised Mind and while that phrasing might make it sound like this book was a drag, it was the exact opposite. It is so densely packed with revelation after revelation, that to read it in a rush is to do yourself an injustice.

        While normally I would keep my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to myself, blogging more is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact.
