        On the 30th of November this year I ran the 35km Ultra Trail in Cape Town.
At a glance, it took me a total of 8 hours 15 minutes to complete with an average pace of 13:53 min/km. According to my running watch, I burned 4583 calories with an average heart rate of 156bpm and a max heart rate of 186bpm over the entire 8+ hours.

        First of all, let me apologise in advance. This is going to be a somewhat lengthy one. I had gotten caught up in the development and rounding out of the features, and neglected to report on the progress. However, as it currently stands, the app is in a functional state. So much so that I have been using it consistently in my daily life already, despite some missing features that make it a bit frustrating to use.

        At the end of the previous devlog  I used AsyncTasks to implement the very basic “Add Task” functionality. Next I set to work getting the other most important feature working: the “flow mode”. The flow mode is where the Pomodorro technique I discussed in the very first devlog is applied.

        At this stage the first major functionality of the app has been implemented.
With this devlog I cover how I added data persistence of the tasks as well as the “Add Task” functionality. I used the Room library that comes as part of Android Jetpack for expediency, but nonetheless I had some stumbling blocks and learning points along the way.

        In my last devlog for my productivity app Tempo, I discussed how I had created a CustomView for my Task object, how I would add them directly to my main ConstraintLayout, and how I fixed the layout by using LayoutParams.
In this post, I set out thinking how I was going to discuss implementing the “Add Task” functionality and managing the list of tasks in the MainActivity.

        As a supervillain, I would like to ensure that my minions and peons are working at maximum efficiency. The following post (and probably series) describes my journey in creating a tool that will help them stay productive.
This leads me to a question: What tomatoes, egg timers, and university have in common?
