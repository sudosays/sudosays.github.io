      <description>In order to build an evil empire, one must be able to build. To build things that are robust and long lasting requires the carefully honed skill of the master. Mastery is required if one is to become an effective supervillain. It is important to develop a deep knowledge and mastery over the tools required for one&amp;rsquo;s schemes.</description>

      <description>Pneuma (stylised as pneuma) is an interactive terminal frontend for managing a Hugo blog. As with Tempo, I built it for myself with the features I would like in it.
The aim of the project is to provide a slick, minimal frontend for managing posts in a Hugo blog including the ability to edit and create new posts, as well as publish drafts.</description>

      <description>In my 2020 vision, I mentioned that this year I wanted to contribute to an open source project and I am happy to announce that my first ever pull request was merged. This post mainly concerns my experience of the contribution process and my thoughts throughout rather than an in depth technical report.</description>
