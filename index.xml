      <description>While normally I would keep my New Year&#39;s resolutions to myself, blogging more is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact.</description>

      <description>On the 30th of November this year I ran the 35km Ultra Trail in Cape Town.
At a glance, it took me a total of 8 hours 15 minutes to complete with an average pace of 13:53 min/km. According to my running watch, I burned 4583 calories with an average heart rate of 156bpm and a max heart rate of 186bpm over the entire 8+ hours.</description>

      <title>Devlog #4: Tempo</title>

      <description>First of all, let me apologise in advance. This is going to be a somewhat lengthy one. I had gotten caught up in the development and rounding out of the features, and neglected to report on the progress. However, as it currently stands, the app is in a functional state. So much so that I have been using it consistently in my daily life already, despite some missing features that make it a bit frustrating to use.</description>

      <description>At the end of the previous devlog  I used AsyncTasks to implement the very basic “Add Task” functionality. Next I set to work getting the other most important feature working: the “flow mode”. The flow mode is where the Pomodorro technique I discussed in the very first devlog is applied.</description>

      <description>At this stage the first major functionality of the app has been implemented.
With this devlog I cover how I added data persistence of the tasks as well as the “Add Task” functionality. I used the Room library that comes as part of Android Jetpack for expediency, but nonetheless I had some stumbling blocks and learning points along the way.</description>

      <description>In my last devlog for my productivity app Tempo, I discussed how I had created a CustomView for my Task object, how I would add them directly to my main ConstraintLayout, and how I fixed the layout by using LayoutParams.
In this post, I set out thinking how I was going to discuss implementing the “Add Task” functionality and managing the list of tasks in the MainActivity.</description>

      <description>As a supervillain, I would like to ensure that my minions and peons are working at maximum efficiency. The following post (and probably series) describes my journey in creating a tool that will help them stay productive.
This leads me to a question: What tomatoes, egg timers, and university have in common?</description>

      <title>Vim Leadership Revisited</title>

      <description>A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can read that here). Now, after using it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I have learned.
First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all beware your timeouts.</description>

      <title>Arming Henchmen: Hacking Guns</title>

      <description>I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video here.
TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between the watch and gun and prevent it from firing.</description>

      <title>Being a Leader in Vim</title>

      <description>As far as using IDEs go, I wouldn’t say I’ve been around the block, but I’ve seen my fair share. It was only when I started running Arch Linux that I first switched to vim. At this point you might be expecting me to sing vim’s praises and how every developer worth their salt should be using it.</description>

      <description>You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions, “How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive heat death anyway?”, to which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).</description>
