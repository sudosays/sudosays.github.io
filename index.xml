      <description>Admittedly, the third week in January is a bit late to post my New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution, but better late than never.
Last year, I had a focus on growth with a community slant to it. I donated blood, contributed to an open source project and tried to add to myself.</description>

      <description>What a year this has been. I am sure many are starting their end of the year posts like this, but if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate now, it never will be. This year I set out my goals/resolutions with the theme of growth, specifically I chose things that were always deferred and, well, if this year was not almost deferred itself.</description>

      <description>Money is the root of all evil. Our evil endeavors can only succeed if we are well funded. More so, our funds should come from either an untraceable or laundered source. While cryptocurrency is a viable payment method that seems reasonably untraceable, let us not stake our funds on a somewhat volatile market.</description>

      <description>Yet again it is time for another update. The past month I have been incredibly busy. I have recently taken up a lecturing position for a Java course at a local university. While entirely online/remote, the work is quite time consuming if not overly difficult. I have found it interesting to develop an effective workflow and schedule, and to find the relevant tools that allow me to do so.</description>

      <description>It is time again for me to fill you in with another status update. I have been incredibly busy with my academics this past while which has left little time for side-projects (despite how much I would like to work on them). What little time I have free I have been surfing, meditating, doing yoga, and sleeping to try and recover and recoup.</description>

      <description>This post is inspired by the status updates of Drew DeVault (who remains a large inspiration for keeping this blog as a whole). This entry is a bit late, but better than never. In future I think I will also try to update at the middle of each month. This is also a chance to add updates from my life that do not warrant a full post here or may seem unrelated to the spirit of this blog.</description>

      <description>This is my personal productivity app. It started from trying to merge the Pomodoro technique with a to-do list so that I could budget and plan my time. Other productivity apps I had used in the past featured either a timer only, or a to-do list, but not both. Furthermore, I use this to help keep me in a flow state by reducing the amount of effort I need to structure my work.</description>

      <description>One of the important factors in being a supervillain is that you need to be able to get your word out there. This can be for multiple reasons such as recruiting henchmen, drawing the ire of heroes, networking with other supervillains, and the list goes on. For an incipient supervillain such as myself, this comes in the form of my blog.</description>

      <description>In my 2020 vision, I mentioned that this year I wanted to contribute to an open source project and I am happy to announce that my first ever pull request was merged. This post mainly concerns my experience of the contribution process and my thoughts throughout rather than an in depth technical report.</description>

      <title>Book Review - The Organised Mind</title>

      <description>Last night I finally managed to finish Daniel Levitin&amp;rsquo;s The Organised Mind and while that phrasing might make it sound like this book was a drag, it was the exact opposite. It is so densely packed with revelation after revelation, that to read it in a rush is to do yourself an injustice.</description>

      <description>While normally I would keep my New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions to myself, blogging more is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact.</description>

      <description>On the 30th of November this year I ran the 35km Ultra Trail in Cape Town.
At a glance, it took me a total of 8 hours 15 minutes to complete with an average pace of 13:53 min/km. According to my running watch, I burned 4583 calories with an average heart rate of 156bpm and a max heart rate of 186bpm over the entire 8+ hours.</description>

      <description>First of all, let me apologise in advance. This is going to be a somewhat lengthy one. I had gotten caught up in the development and rounding out of the features, and neglected to report on the progress. However, as it currently stands, the app is in a functional state. So much so that I have been using it consistently in my daily life already, despite some missing features that make it a bit frustrating to use.</description>

      <description>At the end of the previous devlog  I used AsyncTasks to implement the very basic “Add Task” functionality. Next I set to work getting the other most important feature working: the “flow mode”. The flow mode is where the Pomodorro technique I discussed in the very first devlog is applied.</description>

      <description>At this stage the first major functionality of the app has been implemented.
With this devlog I cover how I added data persistence of the tasks as well as the “Add Task” functionality. I used the Room library that comes as part of Android Jetpack for expediency, but nonetheless I had some stumbling blocks and learning points along the way.</description>

      <description>In my last devlog for my productivity app Tempo, I discussed how I had created a CustomView for my Task object, how I would add them directly to my main ConstraintLayout, and how I fixed the layout by using LayoutParams.
In this post, I set out thinking how I was going to discuss implementing the “Add Task” functionality and managing the list of tasks in the MainActivity.</description>

      <description>As a supervillain, I would like to ensure that my minions and peons are working at maximum efficiency. The following post (and probably series) describes my journey in creating a tool that will help them stay productive.
This leads me to a question: What tomatoes, egg timers, and university have in common?</description>

      <description>A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can read that here). Now, after using it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I have learned.
First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all beware your timeouts.</description>

      <title>Arming Henchmen: Hacking Guns</title>
      <link>http://sudosays.github.io/blog/arming-henchmen-hacking-guns/</link>

      <guid>http://sudosays.github.io/blog/arming-henchmen-hacking-guns/</guid>
      <description>I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video here.
TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between the watch and gun and prevent it from firing.</description>

      <description>As far as using IDEs go, I wouldn’t say I’ve been around the block, but I’ve seen my fair share. It was only when I started running Arch Linux that I first switched to vim. At this point you might be expecting me to sing vim’s praises and how every developer worth their salt should be using it.</description>

      <description>You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions, “How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive heat death anyway?”, to which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).</description>
