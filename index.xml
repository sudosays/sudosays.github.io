      <description>A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can read that here). Now, after using it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I have learned.
First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all beware your timeouts.
Vim on timeout After a while of using a custom leader key I started noticing that vim would lag for approximately a second every now and then.</description>

      <title>Arming Henchmen: Hacking Guns</title>

      <description>I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video here.
TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between the watch and gun and prevent it from firing.</description>

      <title>Being a Leader in Vim</title>

      <description>As far as using IDEs go, I wouldn’t say I’ve been around the block, but I’ve seen my fair share. It was only when I started running Arch Linux that I first switched to vim. At this point you might be expecting me to sing vim’s praises and how every developer worth their salt should be using it. I’m not going to.
The learning curve for vim is steep. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what the different modes meant, and everyday I use it I learn something new.</description>

      <description>You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions, “How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive heat death anyway?”, to which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).
The Evil Company Inc is not actually about, say, maiming puppies and enslaving people, but rather about a subverting the depiction of supervillians in media.</description>
