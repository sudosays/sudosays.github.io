    <div class="post-content">
    <p>This post is inspired by the status updates of Drew DeVault (who remains a
large inspiration for keeping this blog as a whole). This entry is a bit late,
but better than never. In future I think I will also try to update at the
middle of each month. This is also a chance to add updates from my life that do
not warrant a full post here or may seem unrelated to the spirit of this blog.</p>
<p>My last post to this blog was &ldquo;<a href="http://sudosays.github.io/blog/be-static-to-go-faster/">Be Static To Go Faster</a>&rdquo; which dates back to the 25th of February
this year. In the intervening months, many, many things have happened. I have
been working towards the completion of my Master&rsquo;s degree, drafted a whole
bunch of posts only to abandon them later. These last few months of quarantine
and lockdown have been incredibly turbulent and the time slipped by in the
blink of an eye.</p>
<p>I do not have much else to report as of now. There are a few things in the
works especially with respect to Tempo and other projects. However, I will be
focusing mainly on my degree for the next while.</p>
<p>Until then, study hard and, stay evil.</p>
