    <h1 class="post-title">Vim Leadership Revisited</h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tuesday, Nov 14, 2017</span>

    
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can
read that <a href="http://sudosays.github.io/blog/being-a-leader-in-vim/">here</a>). Now, after using
it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I
have learned.</p>
<p>First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all
beware your timeouts.</p>
<h2 id="vim-on-timeout">Vim on timeout</h2>
<p>After a while of using a custom leader key I started noticing that vim would
lag for approximately a second every now and then. At first I thought it was
the plugins I had installed that were causing vim to render slowly,  but after
removing them the problem persisted. Then I thought it was my fancy text
highlighting using the cursorline settings, but after removing that too I still
had the same problem. The only thing left in my vimrc were the leader key
remaps.</p>
<p>As it turns out, vim automatically has a timeout setting that can get quite
annoying when your leader key is <code>&lt;Space&gt;</code>. Essentially, vim will wait until it
is sure that it has or has not recieved a mapping before typing anything to
screen. This meant that everytime I hit <code>&lt;Space&gt;</code> vim would wait for up to one
second before being sure that I did not type a custom leader mapping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You should try it yourself and not just take my word for it&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when I checked the vim help system I found the following two options regarding timeout:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>timeout</code></li>
<li><code>ttimeout</code></li>
</ol>
<p><code>timeout</code> is the default behaviour of vim and it waits for an entire mapping
whereas <code>ttimeout</code> will timeout on key codes.</p>
<p>This means that I wanted <code>timeout</code> off and <code>ttimeout</code> on so that my vim would
continue to add keys until it matches a mapping for the leader key. You should
try it yourself and not just take my word for it. Run the following commands in
vim to test them out:</p>
<p><code>:set noto</code> and <code>:set to</code></p>
<p><code>:set nottimeout</code> and <code>:set ttimeout</code></p>
<p>Try different combinations of <code>timeout</code> and <code>ttimeout</code> to see what best suits your
editing style.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-leadership">Change of leadership</h2>
<p>However, I found that using comma (&lsquo;<code>,</code>&rsquo;) instead of <code>&lt;Space&gt;</code> was a much better
leader key and is not too awkward to use. The nice thing about this is that you
only have to change you leader key and all your mappings will still work.</p>
