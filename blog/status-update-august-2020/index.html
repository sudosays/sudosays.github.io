    <div class="post-content">
    <p>Yet again it is time for another update. The past month I have been incredibly
busy. I have recently taken up a lecturing position for a Java course at a
local university. While entirely online/remote, the work is quite time
consuming if not overly difficult. I have found it interesting to develop an
effective workflow and schedule, and to find the relevant tools that allow me
to do so.</p>
<p>For those interested, my current &ldquo;stack&rdquo;/workflow for lectures is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing all slides and notes in Markdown</li>
<li>Compiling to Beamer slides with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a></li>
<li>Recording of lecture videos material with <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit 5</a> for automated assignment marking and testing</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sakailms.org/">Sakai</a> for student interaction and assessments</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also found myself using <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a> quite a
bit, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I really like it. Something about the usage seems to
rub at me. For a while I was considering adding Taskwarrior support to Tempo,
but I will probably hold off for now.</p>
<p>Other than that, I am currently preparing a paper for the SACAIR conference as
part of my MSc work. It is proving an intense process, but I expected it would
be.</p>
<p>In what free time I have left, I find myself surfing, playing chess, and
playing Bloodborne (although not that often).</p>
<p>I find myself itching to work on Tempo as well as a plethora of other personal
project ideas (mostly in Go). For now though, they will have to remain on the
backburner. Until the next update, keep well in these interesting times.</p>
