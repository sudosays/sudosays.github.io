    <div class="post-content">
    <p>
All of the patches submitted to the Linux Kernel by researchers from the University
of Minnesota have been reverted and all future contributions from <code>@umn.edu</code>
email addresses will be flatly ignored. What follows is a cautionary tale of how
<em>not</em> to conduct research using human subjects.</p>
<p>
In short, the Linux kernel developers noticed that researchers from the
University of Minnesota were submitting patches to the kernel that were
introducing vulnerabilities. The researchers claimed that these patches
contained bug-fixes generated by their static analysis tool. Upon digging deeper,
kernel developers realised that previous patches submitted by this group were
intentionally malicious as part of &#34;research&#34; on using hypocrite commits to
inject vulnerabilities into OSS projects (using Linux as an example). To make
matters worse, it was discovered that some of these patches had already
propagated to &#34;stable&#34; trees meaning they could potentially affect devices in
the wild.</p>
<p>
When accused of submitting bad-faith patches, the researchers doubled down on
their arguments. At this point famed kernel developer and overall badass  <a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/">Greg
Koah-Hartman</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/gregkh">@gregkh</a> on twitter) banned their institution from future
submissions and began ripping out all of their patches. In his email to the
researchers, he signed off the message with a dreaded <code>*plonk*</code>: the sound of
someone or something dumped into the email oubliette.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>
While the researchers claim that they were trying to test the OSS contribution
vetting/security system, they did so without informing any of the kernel
developers. Since the kernel patch review process is largely a human one, by
attacking the process the researchers were effectively experimenting on the
kernel developers and maintainers themselves. The researchers failed to see that
ultimately they were studying the trust levels of the developers and not the
&#34;system&#34;. Furthermore, by submitting purposefully malicious patches they were
using up human time and effort (in a project that depends on volunteers) for
their own benefit with little to no contribution to the kernel efforts itself.
This type of one-sided behaviour found in nature can be described as parasitic.</p>
<p>
During the damage control, it came to light that the University&#39;s own ethics
board had greenlit the research despite initially trying to distance themselves
from their own CS department. Overall, the entire situation was a clusterbomb of
mistakes, and arrogance.</p>
<p>
Performing research on unaware humans is — it turns out — not the way to go.
That is the type of malicious behaviour reserved for authoritarian governments,
and mindless corporations. As potential supervillains, we understand that human
experimentation is sometimes necessary, but that <em>unsanctioned</em> experimentation
on humans is not just bad, it is stupid.</p>
<p>
The kernel developers themselves suggested a way to have gone about it. Work
with a select group of higher-ups (such as Greg) to target specific parts of the
kernel with known patches. When these patches arrive in Greg&#39;s email, he
notifies the researcher that the patches have gone through, and they work
together to notify and educate the developers that the patches fooled. In this
scenario, everybody wins and you graduate to a symbiotic relationship. If you
are tempted to perform experiments on humans, do it in the open with clearance
and you can get away with it. Try to do so surreptitiously, and you will be
publicly ousted — or worse get plonked.</p>
