    <h1 class="post-title">Arming Henchmen: Hacking Guns</h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wednesday, Aug 23, 2017</span>

    
    <div class="post-content">
    <p>I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to
exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video
<a href="https://www.wired.com/video/how-a-hacker-fired-a-locked-smart-gun-with-15-of-magnets">here</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the
gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire
without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between
the watch and gun and prevent it from firing. The hacker was also able to
extend the distance the watch has to be for the gun to fire with the use of a
transmitter and repeater. Granted, the hacker investigated the specific
frequencies that the gun and watch used to authenticate and communicate, but
the firing without the watch was done simply using magnets that exploited the
mechanical aspects of the security system.</p>
<p>Now there are a few things I want to touch on here and hopefully I will be able
to frame it within the context of arming the henchmen of my evil corporation.
After all, that is the theme of this blog.</p>
<p>Firstly, despite its security flaws, I would arm my henchmen with smart guns.
They are already more secure than the regular guns we have today. What the
smart guns do is raise the bar for the gun to be operated.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A common thing we see nowadays is what I like to call the ‘henchmen ammo supply
chain’ where the hero works their way through a villains compound by
systematically neutralising every minion in their way and taking their weapons
as they go along. Effectively, the hero is given a steady stream of usable
weaponry to help them along. Using smart guns, the hero will be unable to use
the dropped guns, only their ammo. Even then, if the hero isn’t using the exact
same model and calibre gun themselves, they will probably not even be able to
use the ammo.</p>
<p>This is a good way to break the hero’s momentum through your evil lair by
ensuring that they run out of resources fairly quickly and are unable to
resupply.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of using a smart watch, I would invest in biometric security
for my smart guns such as a fingerprint sensor (<a href="https://youtu.be/wueZubd_S2o">which has been
developed</a>).  Given the form factors we can
achieve with our fingerprint sensors on our phones, this seems like a pretty
good idea to do. To push this idea even further, what if the gun was not only
linked to the user’s fingerprint, but also tapped into their entire system
measuring heart rate, brain activity, and so on. That way we could use this
information to not only authenticate, but also possibly map their intent and
use that to decide whether or not the gun will fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What the smart guns do is raise the bar for the gun to be operated.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that said, this was an interesting case of a simple workaround to some
seemingly complex security. If your system has a simplistic mechanical bypass
how secure is it really? In the case of smart guns, I would argue they are
still safer than normal, unsecured guns. This comes with the caveat that the
‘smart’ part involves authentication only and not actual fire control. Giving
anyone a way to fire guns remotely/smartly is just a really, really bad idea.</p>
<p>To bring it back to a real world context, guns are weapons. Like a club or
mace, a gun is not dangerous by itself, but when it is wielded it is capapble
of taking a life. By using smart technology to restrict the operation of a gun
even further, I think we can make guns much safer than they currently are and
also hinder the trade of guns since the authentication is something that will
have to be transferred from seller to buyer. Even though exploits exist, I
would argue that currently, it is much easier for someone to aquire a ‘dumb’
gun and use that than go through the trouble of trying to hack a smart gun.
Inevitably we humans are lazy and will choose the easiest path.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is: while the media hype may make it seem like smart
guns with vulnerabilities should not be used, it is in fact the opposite
because they are already safer than normal guns despite their exploits.</p>
<p>P.S. Let us agree to never ever connect guns to the internet. Ever.</p>
