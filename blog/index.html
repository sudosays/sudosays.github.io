        First of all, let me apologise in advance. This is going to be a somewhat lengthy one. I had gotten caught up in the development and rounding out of the features, and neglected to report on the progress. However, as it currently stands, the app is in a functional state. So much so that I have been using it consistently in my daily life already, despite some missing features that make it a bit frustrating to use.

        At the end of the previous devlog  I used AsyncTasks to implement the very basic “Add Task” functionality. Next I set to work getting the other most important feature working: the “flow mode”. The flow mode is where the Pomodorro technique I discussed in the very first devlog is applied. All it shows is a timer and the task you are supposed to be focusing on.
Now like the esteemed ex-convict Martha Stewart, I had already prepared a lot of the logic for the flow activity before this point.

        At this stage the first major functionality of the app has been implemented.
With this devlog I cover how I added data persistence of the tasks as well as the “Add Task” functionality. I used the Room library that comes as part of Android Jetpack for expediency, but nonetheless I had some stumbling blocks and learning points along the way. Regardless, I would highly recommend using Room so as to not get bogged down with how to query data from the SQLite database and increasing your chances of mucking something up “accidentally”.

        In my last devlog for my productivity app Tempo, I discussed how I had created a CustomView for my Task object, how I would add them directly to my main ConstraintLayout, and how I fixed the layout by using LayoutParams.
In this post, I set out thinking how I was going to discuss implementing the “Add Task” functionality and managing the list of tasks in the MainActivity. However, fate it seems is not without a sense of irony.

        As a supervillain, I would like to ensure that my minions and peons are working at maximum efficiency. The following post (and probably series) describes my journey in creating a tool that will help them stay productive.
This leads me to a question: What tomatoes, egg timers, and university have in common? They are all part of Francesco Cirillo’s Pomodoro technique that aims to manage time and tasks efficiently. The basics are that you have indivisible units of working time separated by short breaks and that you focus solely on the task at hand during a working unit.

        A while ago I wrote about my discovery of using the leader key in vim (you can read that here). Now, after using it for a while I would like to revisit it and share my experiences and what I have learned.
First of all, do not use the spacebar for your leader key, and second of all beware your timeouts.
Vim on timeout After a while of using a custom leader key I started noticing that vim would lag for approximately a second every now and then.

        I recently watched a video on Wired about a person who found multiple ways to exploit a ‘smart gun’. You can watch that video here.
TL;DR the gun is accompanied by a watch that, when it is close enough to the gun, allows it to shoot. The hacker is able to not only make the gun fire without having the watch nearby, but is also able to jam the signals between the watch and gun and prevent it from firing.

        As far as using IDEs go, I wouldn’t say I’ve been around the block, but I’ve seen my fair share. It was only when I started running Arch Linux that I first switched to vim. At this point you might be expecting me to sing vim’s praises and how every developer worth their salt should be using it. I’m not going to.
The learning curve for vim is steep. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what the different modes meant, and everyday I use it I learn something new.

        You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions, “How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive heat death anyway?”, to which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).
The Evil Company Inc is not actually about, say, maiming puppies and enslaving people, but rather about a subverting the depiction of supervillians in media.
