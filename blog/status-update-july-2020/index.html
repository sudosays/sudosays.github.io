    <div class="post-content">
    <p>It is time again for me to fill you in with another status update. I have been
incredibly busy with my academics this past while which has left little time
for side-projects (despite how much I would like to work on them). What little
time I have free I have been surfing, meditating, doing yoga, and sleeping to
try and recover and recoup.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what my workload looks like I mapped it with
Matplotlib+Numpy using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32485907/matplotlib-and-numpy-create-a-calendar-heatmap">Joe
Kinton&rsquo;s
answer</a>
on Stack Overflow as a starting point.</p>

<p>My productivity app Tempo has seen some slight changes as I have tinkered away
at it and I have been using it relentlessly to keep myself focused and maintain
my work momentum. A lot has been changed and improved since the last devlog and
frankly another one is long overdue. Yet again, I have found that using my app
constantly really brings to light any issues or quirks that annoy me which has
been a great way to know what things I need to change or polish first.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been writing more Go in my spare time &mdash; mostly with toy
projects &mdash; and I have to say that I am quickly falling in love with it. I had
expected my self to prefer Rust, but somehow Go pleasantly surprised me with
the dev tools. In some way I feel that Go has been a lot easier for me to grok
than Rust.</p>
<p>That does not mean that I have abandoned learning Rust, but rather
that I have shelved it for now in favour of focusing on mastering Go. I am
still especially interested in adding Rust to my repertoire especially since
there is talk of including <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">in-tree Rust
support</a>.</p>
