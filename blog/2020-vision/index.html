    <div class="post-content">
    <p>While normally I would keep my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to myself, blogging more
is one of them. If I could control how this year will turn out for me I would
summarise it in one word: growth. My aim this year is to extend myself in as
many aspects as I can while ensuring lasting impact. As such, I have narrowed
it down to five resolutions or goals.</p>
<p>Not all of these conform to the S.M.A.R.T principle of goal setting, but I
don&rsquo;t think resolutions have to be such hard goals. Regardless, they are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to an open source initiative</li>
<li>Donate blood</li>
<li>Become more flexible (with yoga)</li>
<li>Write more (in this blog and elsewhere)</li>
<li>Complete a personal project</li>
</ul>
<p>I had trouble deciding on which ones exactly to include here, but I think these
represent things that I had always told myself I would get around to at some
point. They represent deferred, delayed, and abandoned ideas/goals that I think
make them prime candidates for this year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the growth I seek is commitment: building on things that I believe
will make me a better, more dedicated person while contributing to my community
(online or otherwise).</p>
<p>For each of these, I have included a brief on how I imagined they would be
accomplished or how I envisioned them.</p>
<p>Open source initiatives to contribute to include Wikipedia, and Rust-based
projects for helping me learn the language.</p>
<p>Donating blood is pretty self-explanatory, I am ashamed to say I have never
really done it before and it has always been a goal.</p>
<p>Becoming more flexible is a physical challenge I set myself since I recovered
from my advanced shin splints. Lack of flexibility in my hamstrings was one of
the leading factors to the development of what could have been a chronic
injury.</p>
<p>Writing more involves building out this blog and taking the initiative to share
my knowledge and personal discoveries with others. Blogs like <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew
DeVault&rsquo;s</a> are a big source of inspiration for this
one. I also have many other writing projects that have simply never been a
priority.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to see a personal project through to completion. My project
graveyard stretches across the horizon while my harvest remains empty. I hope
to start adding to the archive and showcase of this blog at least one project.</p>
<p>If I were to challenge you &mdash; dear reader &mdash; to anything this year it would
be this: find something you have always deferred and just start the work on it.</p>
