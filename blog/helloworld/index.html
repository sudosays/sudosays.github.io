    <div class="post-content">
    <p>You might have found yourself here and asked yourself the following questions,
“How did I get here? Why am I reading a blog about a malignant enterprise? What
is the point of the universe if it’ll end in a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe">heat
death</a> anyway?”, to
which I have the answers (except for the first and last one).</p>
<p>The Evil Company Inc is not actually about, say, maiming puppies and enslaving
people, but rather about a subverting the depiction of supervillians in media.
It’s realising that the archetype villian, although misguided and usually
insane, actually contains all the qualities that people today aspire to have
themselves. This is probably a product of my love for V for Vendetta and
Megamind blending together, but hear me out.</p>
<p>A villain is usually:</p>
<ol>
<li>goal driven</li>
<li>dedicated</li>
<li>enthusiastic</li>
<li>hardworking</li>
<li>passionate</li>
<li>tenacious</li>
</ol>
<p>The villian is highly focused on one specific goal or outcome that they will
stop at nothing to achieve (not even the deafening awesomeness of the hero). It
consumes them and drives them forward. They continually scheme about better
ways to succeed. They also love what they do and enjoy their evil schemes every
step of the way. Despite being soundly beaten time after time by the hero, the
villain will find a way to get back in the game. Villians are also job
creators. They employ hundreds if not thousands of henchmen, minions, and
thugs. Did you ever wonder what happened to Nondescript Thug #42 when the hero
destroyed the villains evil empire?</p>
<p>What I’m trying to get at is, adopting the nature of an evil villain is not
bad. One way to get there is by accumulating knowledge. I found the following
quote quite fitting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Knowledge is power. Power corrupts. Study hard. Be evil.&rsquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nathan Bridges, Mankind&rsquo;s Dilemma</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My plan, therefore, is to become a supervillian. And like all my supervillian
contemporaries I’ll need to make my plans and schemes known to any heros that
might need something to try and thwart.</p>
<p>What you can expect to find here?</p>
<p>I plan on posting articles about my experiences in programming, updates and
posts on any games I’m developing, and general other stuff (like my trips if I
go travelling). Check my bio in the sidebar for what I’m interested in as
that’s probably what I’ll post about.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I’d like to welcome you to my evil labratory. I hope
you’ll stick around and see something cool once in a while and that the
shackles aren’t too uncomfortable.</p>
